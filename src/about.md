text: "<p>David is a Systems Engineer employed by a large multi-national engineering company who kindly allow him to work reduced hours so that he has time to spend one day a week designing, organising and delivering Robotics Workshops. As an undergraduate he was sponsored by British Aerospace who used to have a large aircraft factory in North Kingston.  David obtained an Honours degree in Electronic Engineering at Kingston University in 1984 and continued to be employed by BAe until the  factory closed in the early 1990's when he moved on to work for Thales where he still works as of 2021.</p><h3>STEM</h3><p>David has a passion to introduce technology to young people and to encourage anyone who is interested to consider a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering & Maths) based career. However it is his belief that <strong>everyone</strong> should have the opportunity to understand how basic electronic circuits work and how to programme a computer; whether or not they ultimately aspire to a technology based job.  That is why Robotics Workshops are aimed at anyone, young or old who has the desire to find out a bit more about how the mobile phone in their pocket works, or who just wants to build a robot to obtain world domination!</p>"
