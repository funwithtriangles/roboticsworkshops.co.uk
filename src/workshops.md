introText: "<p>The workshop activities will be challenging for many of the attendees. But advice and instructions will be provided. You will not be expected to know how to solder a transistor; or how programme a robot! Most of those taking part in the workshops enjoy the opportunity to do something that they have not done before. See below for examples of workshops that we can deliver:</p>"

    text: "<p>This workshop involves building a small Lego robotic vehicle and then programming it to move around the room and use a bump detector to sense its environment. These little robots can also play simple tunes, have built-in sound effects and also have LEDs fitted. The software provides access to control these features. The programs are written on a laptop PC and then downloaded onto the robot. The programming software is a “C like” language with built in robotic control statements. Example programs are first given to the students to type in and download; then the students are challenged to further develop these programs themselves.</p>"
