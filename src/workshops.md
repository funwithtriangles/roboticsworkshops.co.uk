title: The Workshops
header: No experience necessary
introText: <p>The workshop activities will be challenging for many of the
  attendees. But advice and instructions will be provided. You will not be
  expected to know how to solder a transistor; or how programme a robot! Most of
  those taking part in the workshops enjoy the opportunity to do something that
  they have not done before. See below for examples of workshops that we can
  deliver:</p>

    imageAlt: Lego robots!
    text: <p>This workshop involves building a small Lego robotic vehicle and then
      programming it to move around the room and use a bump detector to sense
      its environment. These little robots can also play simple tunes, have
      built-in sound effects and also have LEDs fitted. The software provides
      access to control these features. The programs are written on a laptop PC
      and then downloaded onto the robot. The programming software is a “C like”
      language with built in robotic control statements. Example programs are
      first given to the students to type in and download; then the students are
      challenged to further develop these programs themselves.</p>

    imageAlt: Crumble robot
    text: <p>The “Crumble” is a small microcontroller board, very similar to the BBC
      Micro:bit board with a number of inputs and outputs. The Crumble software
      is drag and drop graphical design language, based on the Scratch
      educational software developed by MIT (Massachusetts Institute of
      Technology). The Crumble is able to drive two DC motors and so is perfect
      for driving a Robot chassis. Crumbles offer a great way for younger
      students (9+) to learn the basics of programming and robotics. And with
      their dual bump sensors, Infra-Red distance sensors, LEDs and Piezo
      speakers the robots are also perfect for older students to learn about
      more advanced sensors (both analogue and digital) and how to control
      them.</p>
  - header: Supercar Activity
    image: /media/crumble-w400.jpg
    imageAlt: Supercar
    text: <p>This activity involves building a small electric car that may be
      powered either from the sun via its solar panel or by a supercapacitor
      which may be charged up via a battery pack or by a handheld dynamo
      generator. A switch on the car selects between the dual power sources.
      This activity involves carefully following instructions to build the
      chassis and then using a soldering station to connect up the electric
      components that drive the car. Students love the final Supercar product
      which looks cool with a glowing LED, runs very fast and which they can
      take home with them.</p>
  - header: Bottle Top Motor
    image: /media/motor-w400.jpg
    imageAlt: bottle top motor
    text: <p>The Bottle Top Motor is built from scratch by the students. The motor
      rotor is made from a plastic milk bottle top on to which are glued four
      small magnets. A specially wound magnetic coil is used to propel the rotor
      around. As with the Supercar above, this motor is powered from a
      supercapacitor which is like a small rechargeable battery that can be
      charged up very quickly and thousands of times. The activity involves
      hammering copper nails into the wooden base and then using the nails as
      electrical terminals onto which are soldered the electrical components
      that make up the motor. The students take home their motors at the end of
      the session.</p>
  - header: Sound-to-Light Electronics Activity
    image: /media/soundtolightpcb-w400.jpg
    imageAlt: Sound to light board
    text: <p>This activity involves building a small sound to light electronic
      circuit. The students first build the circuit using a small plug in
      breadboard. Once they have got the circuit working and developed a basic
      understanding of its operation they build the same circuit again but this
      time with a small PCB and a kit of components which they fit to the board
      using a soldering station. The final product can be turned into a
      high-tech flashing badge which they can wear home!</p>
